Hiya, I'm the readme file, this repository has a homework template developed
particularly for physics, cheismstry and physical chemistry. Some examples of
homeworks written with this template will be in the directory examples.

Compile to have a pdf, you will use the next commands:

`pdflatex homework.text`
