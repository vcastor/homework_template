\noindent{\large{\textbf{Dear Aurore,}}
\vspace*{1.5cm}

I know and I got what you said, with this letter I’m not trying to say that I
don’t trust what you said. I just don’t really understand why. The majority of
relationships breaks up at some point, even if we just date one or two times
more for me it wouldn't be a waste of time.

None of our dates was a waste of time for me. All of our dates will be in me,
always in my best Paris memories.

Do you have another reason to not continuing our dates?, even if I don’t
understand or that hursts me, I’d like to know. Maybe I'm just not enough cute,
lovely, smart, beauty or \textit{tu ne sais pas}. It's not possible force
somebody to love, sometimes isn't enough the coherency at all... sometimes it's
just the heart.

I'm not you, I don't know how was your day, yesterday before I saw you. At
least, I hope that I didn't worsen it. Moreover, I don't know about all you
life, what are you looking for your whole life, whatever that that's means.

Currently, looking for my ticket to get back to Spain, not knowing if I'll be
in Rouen for my PhD, I wrote this letter thinking about you. I'm not thinking
me and you being together for our enteries lifes, but for the short long time
that I had been with you I would've been the happiest girl in Paris.

I promisse not fell in love with you if we meet us again, but it doesn't matter
if you want or not still dating with me, my feelings doesn't changes. I like
you.

Je suis desolé if for you that was a waste of time. Siento tanto no haberte
dado lo que tú buscabas.

Je te suis entièrement reconnaissant.\\
Te quiero.
